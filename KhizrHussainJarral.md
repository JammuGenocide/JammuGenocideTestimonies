Mr. Khizr Hussain Jarral was born in 1934 in the village of Bal Jarrala in Reasi District of Jammu and Kashmir. He was the eldest of four brothers and two sisters. Both his sisters had been married, and they resided in the United Kingdom (UK). His mother was a homemaker, and Mr. Jarral fondly remembers his mother’s makai ki roti (corn flour flatbread) that they ate with fried eggs, butter, and lassi at breakfast. The family resided in a house built of stones, and they had a garden with trees laden with apricots, berries, walnuts, and apples. The village was also home to Mr. Jarral’s extended relatives. His father, uncles, grandfather, and granduncle were officers in the army.
Since Bal Jarrala was located on a slope, the people used horses for daily transport. But only the rich could afford horses of their own. The village was not supplied with electricity, and thus, the inhabitants used a combination of wood and kerosene for cooking as well as lighting lamps. The elders measured time with the help of the length of shadows cast by the sun through the day. “Some army officers used to own watches, but they kept them to themselves,” Mr. Jarral recalls jokingly.
The district of Reasi had been home to Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs for well over a century, but each community lived together in clusters. This meant that families of one religious community resided in a certain part of the village, and hence, that community comprised the majority in that particular area. Nevertheless, the elders of all the communities had cordial relations with each other: they would gather to converse and eat together. Mr. Jarral aptly phrases it when he says that “they were beyond religious differences”.
Although the village had its own tehsildar, judicial courts, and police station, any matter of conflict was usually resolved by the elders of the village through mutual consultation. “We lived in a fairly peaceful area. The people were very nice. The conflicts that surfaced every now and then were minor ones, and the elders were very good at handling them without having to resort to the judiciary,” Mr. Jarral recounts.
After describing his village in vivid detail, Mr. Jarral returns to his own personal story. He mentions that he began attending a school built by his grandfather at the age of four. He was taught by a teacher whom he fondly remembers as being very kind to his students. Mr. Jarral learned to write the Urdu alphabet on takhti’s (wooden boards used for writing in schools) using reed pins and ink in the early days of his schooling.
At the time of Partition, he was thirteen years old. He recalls, “I found out about disturbances in our village when armed men started firing guns at villages indiscriminately in order to draw them out. When the firing broke out in our village as well, I fled with my immediate family, barefoot.” He continues, “We had no idea where we were going. We took directions from people who were kind enough to inform us of safe routes to the Azad Kashmir border. The thoughts that were running through my head at the time was that we had become refugees overnight, with no home to call our own anymore. Deep down inside, after seeing the severity of violence, I knew we were never coming back to our village.”
Mr. Jarral journeyed on foot for several days until they reached the tehsil of Kotli in Mirpur District of Azad Kashmir. The family was allotted an evacuee property on a temporary basis, and they continued to stay there for 12 years. For several of those years, they survived off welfare payments and daily wages.
In 1953, Mr. Jarral joined the army as a sergeant and boxer. He remained in service for 21 years, and he also married during this time. After his retirement in 1974, he joined a sugar mill in Gujranwala, West Punjab, as a security guard, where he remained employed for two decades. In 1976, he was allotted a house by the government in Mirpur District.
Mr. Jarral presently lives comfortably off the pension from his service as a soldier and security guard. He has five sons and a daughter, and he proudly mentions that two of his sons inaugurated the first books and stationary store in their locality. Another two of his sons and his daughter are settled in London, UK. He spends most of his time in the company of his wife, children, and grandchildren at his home. He is extremely happy and grateful for his new life, and the bright future it allowed him to build for his family. He says, “Today, I have no regrets over the life we were forced to leave behind. I am very happy where I am, and I cannot thank god enough for it.”
