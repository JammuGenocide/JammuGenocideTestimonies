-------------------------------------------


Pagh Devi was around 10 years old when she got married. When Partition took place, she recalls that houses of the Muslim residents were set on fire and their village was attacked by armed men. Her maternal family came to her house with their cattle. There were people who protected the village using lathis (sticks) and other weapons as there were rumors that people from other communities will come to attack them. She recalls that lootings were common, and the possessions of the residents who were leaving for Pakistan were especially targeted. She remembers her childhood friends whose families were killed by the mob. She shares how all her friends had left the village and she was the only one left. When she met her friends after a few years of Partition, she couldn’t stop her tears and told them about the unfortunate events and how her brother was killed in front of her eyes. There were rumors that many Muslims had also been killed. Her mother helped a Muslim family and gave them shelter and food. Soon, the Muslim family left for a new place but were killed on their way. According to her, Partition left a deep impact on the minds of people. She believes the future is going to be worse if people don’t choose to live in harmony.
