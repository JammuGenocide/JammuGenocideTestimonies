Testimonies and accounts of the Jammu Genocide

Amongst them was Dr Abdul Karim, who gives below a graphic eyewitness account of what happened to the unfortunate mem bers of the convoy.

    On 6 November 1947, about 25 trucks and lorries were brought into the Police Lines and were at once filled 
    in by anxiously waiting Muslims. Even the roofs were fully packed... A little ahead of Satwari Cantonment, 
    the convoy was halted along the canal side ... the convoy was halted to complete the arrangements for the 
    pre-planned attack on us... Simultaneously, all our belongings were looted.
    Twenty-six members of my family were killed on the spot. My two brothers were killed outright; many members 
    of (my family) were lying in (a) severely wounded condition who died afterwards. My daughter Naeema was abducted.
    I myself received 11 wounds on my body. The grievous wounds on my head and neck made me unconscious for a 
    considerable time so much so that when I recovered consciousness, it was almost dark.
