Testimonies and accounts of the Jammu Genocide

## First hand accounts

1. Amongst them was Dr Abdul Karim, who gives below a graphic eyewitness account of what happened to the unfortunate mem bers of the convoy.

        On 6 November 1947, about 25 trucks and lorries were brought into the Police Lines and were at once filled 
        in by anxiously waiting Muslims. Even the roofs were fully packed... A little ahead of Satwari Cantonment, 
        the convoy was halted along the canal side ... the convoy was halted to complete the arrangements for the 
        pre-planned attack on us... Simultaneously, all our belongings were looted.
        Twenty-six members of my family were killed on the spot. My two brothers were killed outright; many members 
        of (my family) were lying in (a) severely wounded condition who died afterwards. My daughter Naeema was abducted.
        I myself received 11 wounds on my body. The grievous wounds on my head and neck made me unconscious for a 
        considerable time so much so that when I recovered consciousness, it was almost dark.


2.  Similarly, Zarar Hussain, now a central government employee, lives in Sialkot cantonment. He came from Jammu city in late 1947 and recalls the horrors in Jammu at time: 

        The Hindu Dog state troops were at the forefront killings ruth lessly the Muslims in Jammu city. My father was 
        a well-know law yer in Jammu city court. He was attempted to kill by the army. We were forced to quit Jammu for
        Sialkot. My father owned a car so our members of family dove to Sialkot. We left all our possessions in Jammu.
  
3. One of the most compelling interviews conducted in Sialkot was with Hussein Gujrar, who migrated from Ram Nagar to Sialkot in October 1947. He was 18 at the time and now is a resident of Tarowali mohalla of Sialkot. He still remembers the events of that period vividly when all the members of his family was massacred. He recalls: 

        I was about 18 years old at time. One night, the Dogra troopers attacked our home and killed my parents, sister
        and two younger brothers. Luckily, I was not at home that night so remained safe. The next morning when I reached 
        home I saw everywhere bodies and blood. They [the army of the Maharajah] looted everything from the home... 
        I walked from Jammu to Sialkot carrying just one handbag.

4. What happened to them is reproduced below in the words of the Second master of the Samba High School who was one of the passengers:


                "Among them were my old parents, three brothers, two sons and two
                daughters. The trucks started at 2 p.m. At Satwari Cantonment we
                found Hindus and Sikhs assembled on both sides of the road and
                armed to the teeth. Muslims got extremely worried and each one of
                us thought that we were no longer safe. Some youth tried to save
                themselves by jum;ing down from the trucks but where could they
                go? They were killed on the spot. The drivers then diverted the
                trucks towards Kathua road and accelerated the speed. This
                increased our worries. We also found that the Dogra soldiers were
                moving about in the area in jeeps; so we asked the driver as to
                where they were taking us because the road that leads to Pakistan
                goes in a different direction. He told us that that road was closed and
                "Iat we will be taken to Pakistan through a different route. He also
                told us that we need have no worry because if the intention had been
                to kill us, we would have been handed over to Jathas in the
                cantonment. It is difficult to describe the condition of passengers. Out
                of fear they had lost even the power to make any movement; the
                women were weeping bitterly, At that time four or five trucks were
                stopped in the way on the excuse of either the petrol having
                exhausted or some other mechanical defect having creeped in. I
                have hardly been able to meet anyone from this group. It was time
                for evening prayers when four trucks were stopped near the town of
                Samba. As soon as we came down, we were surrounded and taken
                to a ground where we were made to sit. First of all, women were
                separated from us. On two sides of the ground stood a hill, on the
                third side were the trucks, while only one side was open, but on this
                side we found soldiers with fixed machine-guns; so there was no
                side left for us to run away. The assailants had been divided into six
                or seven groups.
                Those who had surrounded us were armed with rifles, spears,
                swords and birchas. Those who snatched away ornaments, money,
                beddings and other property, consisted mostly of Ahhuts; a third
                group was taking possession of women and in overall charge were
                officers who issued orders. The Satanic arrangements were so
                complete and the workers so trained which left no doubt that they
                had been trained over a considerable period of time. The victims
                were then removed to the butchery in a group of six persons each. I
                put off my shoes and ran away and though fired at, was able to save
                my life but my old parents, brothers, sons and daughters who had
                boarded the trucks with myself, I have not heard of them since
                then."
                
5. Revealing his experiences in the disturbed areas of Jammu, Mr. Reddy said in an Interview in Lahore:

                "The mad orgy of Dogra violence against unarmed Muslims should
                put any self-respecting human being to shame. I saw armed bands
                of ruffians and s~!diers shooting down and hacking to pieces
                helpless Muslim refugees heading towards Pakistan. My pain and
                agony was heightened by what I saw at the village of Rajpura where
                the State officials and military officers were directing a huge armed
                mob against a Muslim refugee convoy and got it hacked to pieces. I
                saw en route State officials freely distributing arms and ammunition
                among the Dogras. From the -hotel room where I was detained in
                Jammu I counted as many as 24 villages burning one night and all
                through the night rattling fire of automatic weapons could be heard
                from the surrounding refugee camps."
                
6. One of the eye witnesses to this incident, Abdul Qayum Qureshi,  recalled that there was a big ground where refugees were camping. Volunteers were guarding them, but everybody lived in a state of fear. The extremists and Dogra soldiers had besieged the area but they did not dare to enter inside. Muslim volunteers led by a former army official Captain Naseer-u-din defended the camp bravely. 

                “Meanwhile a fresh group of refugees arrived but the ground was full so they were
                accommodated in an empty Haveli (a mansion). But the killers had taken positions 
                in a trench close to the Haveli. And when people entered the Haveli premises, the
                killers started indiscriminate firing, but the Muslim volunteers fought back. Then
                a Dogra official, Chetan Chopra, arrived with the message that he wanted to talk to
                Captain Naseer-ud-din. Around 4 PM Captain Naseer returned saying the administration
                has announced a ceasefire and assured that the violators will be punished,” Qureshi recalled.
                
 According to him the ceasefire continued for seven days but the situation remained tense. On 5 November Muslims were asked to assemble in the police lines Jammu.              
               “I remember about 26 trucks and buses were present in the police grounds. People were ordered
               to board the vehicles so that they could be driven to Pakistan via Sialkot border. The Dogra
               officials circulated a rumor that these vehicles have reached Pakistan. We had absolutely no ide
               a that they were butchered in the Kuthwa and Samba forests.”

Qureshi says that on 6 November a caravan of refuges in buses and trucks was driven towards the border area. 

                “I was also part of this caravan. But after half an hour drive the entire caravan was turned 
                 towards Bisna. Around 11 AM all of us, about 6000, were dragged out of the buses. Then they 
                 fired at us indiscriminately. The bloodbath continued for nearly three hours; like other
                 people I took refuge in a canal,” he said.
                 
Qureshi recalls that people hid under thorny bushes and wherever they could. At 3 PM the Dogra officials asked the survivors to come out hiding so that they could be driven to safe places. 
                “Having no alternative we came out, and fortunately on the directives of 
                Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah we were later shifted to a refugee camp in Jammu. Only 250 had survived.
                My father was in the Valley and my two brothers were in Mirpur,” he said.
