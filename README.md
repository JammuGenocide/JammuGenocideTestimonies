Testimonies and accounts of the Jammu Genocide

1. Amongst them was Dr Abdul Karim, who gives below a graphic eyewitness account of what happened to the unfortunate mem bers of the convoy.

        On 6 November 1947, about 25 trucks and lorries were brought into the Police Lines and were at once filled 
        in by anxiously waiting Muslims. Even the roofs were fully packed... A little ahead of Satwari Cantonment, 
        the convoy was halted along the canal side ... the convoy was halted to complete the arrangements for the 
        pre-planned attack on us... Simultaneously, all our belongings were looted.
        Twenty-six members of my family were killed on the spot. My two brothers were killed outright; many members 
        of (my family) were lying in (a) severely wounded condition who died afterwards. My daughter Naeema was abducted.
        I myself received 11 wounds on my body. The grievous wounds on my head and neck made me unconscious for a 
        considerable time so much so that when I recovered consciousness, it was almost dark.


2.  Similarly, Zarar Hussain, now a central government employee, lives in Sialkot cantonment. He came from Jammu city in late 1947 and recalls the horrors in Jammu at time: 

        The Hindu Dog state troops were at the forefront killings ruth lessly the Muslims in Jammu city. My father was 
        a well-know law yer in Jammu city court. He was attempted to kill by the army. We were forced to quit Jammu for
        Sialkot. My father owned a car so our members of family dove to Sialkot. We left all our possessions in Jammu.
  
3. One of the most compelling interviews conducted in Sialkot was with Hussein Gujrar, who migrated from Ram Nagar to Sialkot in October 1947. He was 18 at the time and now is a resident of Tarowali mohalla of Sialkot. He still remembers the events of that period vividly when all the members of his family was massacred. He recalls: 

        I was about 18 years old at time. One night, the Dogra troopers attacked our home and killed my parents, sister
        and two younger brothers. Luckily, I was not at home that night so remained safe. The next morning when I reached 
        home I saw everywhere bodies and blood. They [the army of the Maharajah] looted everything from the home... 
        I walked from Jammu to Sialkot carrying just one handbag.
