Testimonies and accounts of the Jammu Genocide

1. Amongst them was Dr Abdul Karim, who gives below a graphic eyewitness account of what happened to the unfortunate mem bers of the convoy.

        On 6 November 1947, about 25 trucks and lorries were brought into the Police Lines and were at once filled 
        in by anxiously waiting Muslims. Even the roofs were fully packed... A little ahead of Satwari Cantonment, 
        the convoy was halted along the canal side ... the convoy was halted to complete the arrangements for the 
        pre-planned attack on us... Simultaneously, all our belongings were looted.
        Twenty-six members of my family were killed on the spot. My two brothers were killed outright; many members 
        of (my family) were lying in (a) severely wounded condition who died afterwards. My daughter Naeema was abducted.
        I myself received 11 wounds on my body. The grievous wounds on my head and neck made me unconscious for a 
        considerable time so much so that when I recovered consciousness, it was almost dark.


2.  Similarly, Zarar Hussain, now a central government employee, lives in Sialkot cantonment. He came from Jammu city in late 1947 and recalls the horrors in Jammu at time: 

        The Hindu Dog state troops were at the forefront killings ruth lessly the Muslims in Jammu city. My father was 
        a well-know law yer in Jammu city court. He was attempted to kill by the army. We were forced to quit Jammu for
        Sialkot. My father owned a car so our members of family dove to Sialkot. We left all our possessions in Jammu.
  
3. One of the most compelling interviews conducted in Sialkot was with Hussein Gujrar, who migrated from Ram Nagar to Sialkot in October 1947. He was 18 at the time and now is a resident of Tarowali mohalla of Sialkot. He still remembers the events of that period vividly when all the members of his family was massacred. He recalls: 

        I was about 18 years old at time. One night, the Dogra troopers attacked our home and killed my parents, sister
        and two younger brothers. Luckily, I was not at home that night so remained safe. The next morning when I reached 
        home I saw everywhere bodies and blood. They [the army of the Maharajah] looted everything from the home... 
        I walked from Jammu to Sialkot carrying just one handbag.

4. What happened to them is reproduced below in the words of the Second master of the Samba High School who was one of the passengers:
                "Among them were my old parents, three brothers, two sons and two
                daughters. The trucks started at 2 p.m. At Satwari Cantonment we
                found Hindus and Sikhs assembled on both sides of the road and
                armed to the teeth. Muslims got extremely worried and each one of
                us thought that we were no longer safe. Some youth tried to save
                themselves by jum;ing down from the trucks but where could they
                go? They were killed on the spot. The drivers then diverted the
                trucks towards Kathua road and accelerated the speed. This
                increased our worries. We also found that the Dogra soldiers were
                moving about in the area in jeeps; so we asked the driver as to
                where they were taking us because the road that leads to Pakistan
                goes in a different direction. He told us that that road was closed and
                "Iat we will be taken to Pakistan through a different route. He also
                told us that we need have no worry because if the intention had been
                to kill us, we would have been handed over to Jathas in the
                cantonment. It is difficult to describe the condition of passengers. Out
                of fear they had lost even the power to make any movement; the
                women were weeping bitterly, At that time four or five trucks were
                stopped in the way on the excuse of either the petrol having
                exhausted or some other mechanical defect having creeped in. I
                have hardly been able to meet anyone from this group. It was time
                for evening prayers when four trucks were stopped near the town of
                Samba. As soon as we came down, we were surrounded and taken
                to a ground where we were made to sit. First of all, women were
                separated from us. On two sides of the ground stood a hill, on the
                third side were the trucks, while only one side was open, but on this
                side we found soldiers with fixed machine-guns; so there was no
                side left for us to run away. The assailants had been divided into six
                or seven groups.
                Those who had surrounded us were armed with rifles, spears,
                swords and birchas. Those who snatched away ornaments, money,
                beddings and other property, consisted mostly of Ahhuts; a third
                group was taking possession of women and in overall charge were
                officers who issued orders. The Satanic arrangements were so
                complete and the workers so trained which left no doubt that they
                had been trained over a considerable period of time. The victims
                were then removed to the butchery in a group of six persons each. I
                put off my shoes and ran away and though fired at, was able to save
                my life but my old parents, brothers, sons and daughters who had
                boarded the trucks with myself, I have not heard of them since
                then."
