--------------------------------------------

Haji Abdul Gani was born in the village Dwada of Jammu District, Princely State of Jammu and Kahsmir. He was around ten years old at the time of Partition. His father owned quite a bit of land where the family would cultivate the seasonal crops. The family also had cattle and sold milk in the market to earn a living.

When Partition broke out in the village, mobs armed with weapons were faced by the army. His family left their home in a hurry, bringing with them few of their possessions. When refugees from West Punjab arrived in Jammu city, more tensions could be felt. The Jattha (Sikh militia) came to his village. They were chanting ‘Maharaja Hari Singh ki jai ho’ or "Victory to Maharaja Hari Singh".

In the initial days of the Partition, his family spent several days in the jungle close to his village. His father was in Sialkot with his maternal aunt at her house. Many of his relatives were killed. On the eve of Bakra Eid, armed mobs gathered in the city and started firing. Thousands of people were killed within three hours.

His family moved to Pakistan and stayed there for a few years, until normalcy returned. They returned to their village. To this day, they have not been able to get over the memories of Partition.
