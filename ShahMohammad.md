----------------------------------------------

Mr. Shah Mohammad was born in Chowadhi village of Jammu District. He was around 12 years old at the time of Partition. His father was an agricultural worker and his mother was a homemaker. On being asked about his childhood, he says that he was fond of desi gur (jaggery) and liked having it in his childhood days. Speaking of his daily routine, he mentions that he had buttermilk for breakfast, after which they went to rear goats in the jungle area near his village. He was friends with people of all communities residing in his village.

Recalling his memories of 1947 and their exile he says, “People from our own neighborhood burned down our houses. They who were our friends killed my family members. We left our homes in the midnight, taking ration (atta or wheat) and blankets with us – as it was winter – and gathered in Gandhi Nagar. The next morning, the army opened fire on those gathered and many were killed. My own brother was also killed in that firing. After that, the border was opened and we went to Pakistan. My family decided to move towards Pakistan as the atmosphere in Jammu was not peaceful. We were around 100-150 people who crossed the border and settled in Sialkot Tehsil. We took refuge in a house belonging to someone who had migrated to the Indian side.” His family spent three years there and then returned to Jammu. They arrived in Jammu at midnight and stayed at a relative’s house. They resumed working on the land that they had before Partition.
