“My father’s only wish all his life was to return to the village in Jammu and rebuild our future there,” says Sultan Begum.

Sultan Begum was born in 1942 in Khor Salarian in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Her father was a farmer and livestock herder, and her mother was the homemaker. Sultan Begum was raised with four sisters and four brothers in their house on the hilly terrain built with stones and a roof of leaves at Khor. Agriculture was her family’s livelihood. Wheat and corn were the main crops grown on the lands owned by her father. She also recalls that wheat was a cash crop in those days and had considered valuable. “One could buy livestock like cows and goats in exchange for wheat. Money was not used in our village for exchanging goods,” she says. The language spoken at home by Sultan Begum was Dogri Kashmiri before Partition.

She remembers that different religious communities had been living together in the village for several generations. “They were on fairly good terms with each other, and would regularly attend each other’s weddings and religious meets,” she recounts. Sultan Begum has seen very little of her ancestral village life during her childhood years. “Purdah was strict for the Muslim girls and women, and we were normally not allowed to go out,” she says.

At the time of Partition, she was five years old. She learned about it from her parents and elder siblings. “It all started when Nowshera became a part of India. Then, we heard that members of two families in our village had been murdered. An informant came to us the following morning and said that insurgents are planning to kill all the Muslim families in the village at night, and we should move to safety immediately. That’s when the decision was made to leave,” Sultan Begum recounts. She remembers the period to be of utmost confusion and fear. “Even though there were many families who wanted to help us in moving from the village, they couldn’t, in fear of losing their own lives,” she says.

Her family, along with 60 other families, set out from Khor on foot in the evening. “We only took some flour to make bread on the way and two horses for the journey,” she recounts. They traveled on foot and horses, and spent the night at Kot Machi Pur in Jammu. Recalling her journey from Khor Salarian to Kot Machi Pur, she says: “Dead bodies were scattered everywhere. I didn’t see any dead person that was not mutilated without mercy,” she says. From Kot Machi Pur, her family walked on for days to get to the army checkpoint at the Samahni Valley. “There was a big market near the valley with mostly Hindu traders and shop owners. Most of them knew my family. They saw us and recognized us instantly, and came rushing towards my family. I saw them hugging each other and sobbing. That for me was a realization that we are going somewhere for good,” she recounts. From Samahni, her family was taken to the Dogi Tor village in Kharian Cantonment where other refugees from Kashmir were also staying. She and her family were allotted an evacuee residential property at the village where they lived under army supervision for two years. After Partition, Sultan Begum was separated from her sisters. Her elder sister had moved to Gujranwala and settled there, while the other elder sister started her new life in Azad Kashmir.

In 1949, her father purchased a plot of land at Mian Mir in Lahore. “The land was used as a funeral pyre ground. The owner was leaving Lahore at the time, and my father managed to buy it from him directly for ten thousand rupees. He built a house for us there, and other Rajput families from Kashmir and we were eventually settled in Lahore,” she says. “My father went through several legal difficulties and court appearances to maintain ownership of the property, from the railways and other provincial government authorities.”

She did not attend school and was married in her early teens to a migrant from Kashmir. Recalling activities from her years growing up in Kharian and Lahore, Sultan Begum says that she remembers fetching water from the wells for the household. After settling in Lahore permanently, she adopted the Lahori Punjabi dialect and converses in that language with her children and grandchildren today. Her husband passed away in 2014. Her father passed away in 2008, at the age of 121 years. “My father’s only wish all his life was to return to the village in Jammu and rebuild our future there. He tried many times to go to Jammu but failed due to severe visa restrictions. He died with that wish to be home again,” she says.

Sharing her thoughts, Sultan Begum says that Indians and Pakistanis should be allowed to visit each other’s countries without any visa requirements or restrictions. “It’s the only way to end this toxic culture of blame, hatred and distrust from both sides. Otherwise, the poor will continue to suffer from its consequences.”
