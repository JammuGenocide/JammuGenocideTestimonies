Bashir Ahmad was born in 1939 in Rathua, a village in Jammu Tehsil and District. His parents were Siraj Din, a farmer, and Rehmat Bibi.

Mr. Ahmad describes his village as ‘paradise on earth.’ It was full of greenery and things were easily available there. It was home to Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Hindus were traders; they ran several shops in the village. They also lent groceries and other goods on credit. Agriculture was the main occupation of Muslims and Sikhs. A few of them also owned shops. They shared brotherly relations with each other. His village also had a Sikh and a Muslim numbardar (state-elected administrative landlord, mainly responsible for collecting revenue).

The village had mosques and gurdwaras. Muslims offered prayers and recited azaan (Islamic call to prayer at prescribed times of the day) at the mosque. They were not allowed to slaughter or consume beef as Hindu and Sikh precepts discouraged it. There was unity in their community.

The villagers had very fertile land and adequate water to irrigate these lands. As a result, their crop yield was high. They cultivated wheat, sugarcane, chickpeas, cereals, spinach, and other vegetables. They also had sufficient fresh and dried fruits.

The villagers bathed with a cleansing agent known as Whig. They were very healthy and mostly travelled on foot. Sometimes, they travelled by horse-drawn wooden carts. Their diet included pure ghee, milk, and curd. They rarely fell ill. They sought hakims (traditional physicians) to treat them with herbs. The nearest city, Jammu, had a hospital. It was one and a half miles away. People also went there to shop.

The villagers lived in mud houses. A few lived in sturdy cement houses. Neither the village, nor the city, had electricity. They lit oil lamps at night. During winter nights, they burnt wood for warmth. Everyone wore khaddar (handspun, hand-woven natural fiber fabric) clothes. They were soothing in the summers and warm in the winters.

Mr. Ahmad recalls that the British were the lawmakers at the time. People strictly adhered to their laws. They were good governors and were just to people. Their relations with certain communities were relatively better. Silver coins and paper notes served as currency at the time.

Mr. Ahmad was eight years old at the time of Partition. Its announcement was accompanied by directives for migration. There was no conflict among the villagers as they lived together and shared good relations. They protected their neighbors from external mob attacks. However, the atmosphere in other villages was frenetic. They experienced a lot of plundering and killing.

Mr. Ahmad’s family departed from the village on wooden carts. They left everything behind: their household belongings, livestock, house, land and crops. It was an acute loss. They were attacked during the journey. His sister-in-law sustained a serious injury. Nevertheless, his family made it safely across the border.

Mr. Ahmad recounts that his family stayed at a refugee camp in Narowal, Punjab. The resident villagers provided them with food. Thereafter, they stayed at a house near the camp. Their neighbors were very helpful. They obtained land from the government and started farming there. Its fertility and crop yield were relatively lower. They later moved to Sialkot. They stayed there for 17 years.

Mr. Ahmad is currently 80 years old. He resides at Toba Tek Singh, Punjab.
