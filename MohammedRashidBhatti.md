-------------------------------------------

Mohammed Rashid Bhatti was born in the village of Govindsar of Kathua District, Jammu and Kashmir. He has four brothers and three sisters. His father was an agriculturalist and his mother, a homemaker. He spent eight years in Pakistan without his parents, living with his paternal uncles and their families. He did not go to school as his family was not with him, he remembers playing kabaddi with his friends. Mr. Bhatti says his family got the news from the surrounding areas that Muslims were not safe in this land.

The effect of Partition started in Jammu and Kashmir, two months after violence broke out in Punjab. His family decided to move towards Pakistan as there were relatives residing over there. During the time of Partition, he and his elder brother were there among the other siblings. Meanwhile, they got the news that Mr. Bhatti’s mother reached her village back during the move with his younger brother. His father had reached the Pakistani district of Sialkot where he resided for a few days. After that, he moved back to the Indian side to take his wife and son back to Pakistan.

“The Rajput community of the village had protected my mother in their homes,” he says, “my father came back from Pakistan to take my mother back with him but the conditions did not allow him and he stayed back here in our ancestral home.” Mr. Bhatti moved across the border to reunite with his family after eight years. After complications regarding his stay, which involved numerous villagers filing police complaints against him, his parents traveled to Jammu to legally announce his arrival into India. Mr. Bhatti says the condition of their ancestral home was not the same as it was before 1947. Their property was totally destroyed and material possessions were looted. All animals were taken by the people. His family’s loss was the only one recorded as his relatives, who had moved across the border, didn’t face any damage to their property. Mr. Bhatti says his family had good relationship ties with all the religious groups before and after Partition. The cordial relations still remain and even today, the people of the village invite them to community programs and celebrations.

Mr. Bhatti says he went to Pakistan twice to meet his relatives by train from Amritsar, East Punjab, to Lahore, West Punjab. In the year 1984, he went to Pakistan for one month and stayed with his paternal uncle’s family, meeting with his siblings residing there. At present, they still reside in the same village where he used to stay with them. His relatives also want to visit the Kathua area but their visas have been rejected. On occasion, they send him letters and contact him. After spending some time praying, he was blessed with a son, whom he named after his paternal uncle. Later, he could not revisit Pakistan due to family pressures. He started working in the fields from the age of ten and spent his whole life in the agricultural field and others, like selling fruit and goats, particularly on the occasion of the Eid.
