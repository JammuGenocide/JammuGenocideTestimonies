-----------------------------

Amarnath was born in a village known as Karoanda in the Bhalwal block of Jammu District. He does not know his birthday but remembers he was 12 years old at the time of Partition, meaning he probably born around 1935. He was raised in a a joint family that included his grandparents, parents, two sisters, six brothers, uncles, and aunts. His family owned a small plot of land that they farmed, but it was not large enough to provide them with enough food, so they would till land owned by Rajput landlords in exchange for half of the crop. Some in the family also worked as laborers or domestic helpers. Mr. Amarnath himself, for example, would sell firewood in Jammu city for 50 paisa. He said that most people at the time lived at a similar level.

The crops grown included wheat, maize, bajra, chickpeas, arhar, moong, masar, til, and mustard. These were all crops that were not too water intensive since rain was the only source of any irrigation. These were all subsistence crops meant for only the family. The only source of potable water was a rainfed pond known as a chapper. Mr. Amarnath says that there were separate entry points, or pattan, to the pond for different castes.

Mr. Amarnath says that his village had a Muslim community. As far as Hindu-Muslim relations go, he says that upper-caste Hindus had good relations with Muslims: caste hierarchy was maintained so strictly that Muslims used to keep a distance from lower castes, of with Mr. Amaranth is a part. There were mosques and temples in the village, the latter only open upper-castes. He says that no one he knew really worshipped God because working to earn enough money to live took up all their time: work became worship.

Mr. Amarnath says that most of the common Hindu festivals like Diwali and Navaratri were celebrated in the village. He says there was a festival for women known as Rott during the month of Savan where they would cook different kinds of food to eat on the banks of the local river. There was also another local festival called Tamdain during the month of Ashard during which people would exchange food with one another. Mr. Amarnath says, however, that poverty at the time was so intense that the only delicacy available during these festivals was halwa. He does remember going to the Nagbani fair with his father.

He says that no one knew about Partition until a Muslim from a nearby border village came to their village to tell his fellow Muslims that massacres were going on at the border and that they must therefore leave for Pakistan as soon as possible. The very next day, Karonda was attacked. Many people managed to run safely to Pakistan but many women and children were mercilessly murdered as well. Mr. Amarnath and his family hid themselves in the maize fields for fear of being caught up in the violence. He remembers that Muslim houses were set on fire along with any grain stored in them. Later that year and into the next, there was an acute shortage of grain to eat. He says starvation was so intense that people would eat leftover wheat fibers or raw bajra.

He says that few people returned to their ancestral homes after Partitons. Many of those who came from Pakistan to India settled in any abandoned houses left standing.

Mr. Amarnath got married when he was 25 years old. He has four sons and one daughter. He now lives with his wife and his youngest sonâ€™s family. He still works in the fields a little bit.
