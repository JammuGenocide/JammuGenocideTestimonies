--------------------------------------

Khawaja Muhammad Yahya Butt was born in Samba, Jammu, Kashmir in 1930. He recalls that Samba was composed of several small mohallas and that his mohalla had five houses in total. He says that the residents belonged to a diverse range of communities and life was simple and peaceful.

He recalls that education was free until matriculation and Samba had one of the best
schools in the region that attracted students from Sialkot and Gurdaspur. Festivals such as Holi, Diwali, and Dussehra were celebrated in the village. He recalls that three types of calendars
were used, Islamic, Bikrami and English. The Bikrami calendar was most common, especially for work purposes. People usually travelled by foot, but used horse carriages for longer distances.

He recalls that there was no conflict in his surroundings until late 1947. His family did not anticipate the chaos and violence that would accompany Partition even when it was announced in August 1947. He shares an anecdote from this time when he caught two lion cubs that were floating in the water. He gave one of them to a friend, who happened to be of a different religious background. Mr. Butt notes that there was no trace of religious discord at this time. He recalls that the situation changed drastically by November 1947 and violence erupted in Samba. Mr. Butt was visiting some relatives in Lahore when a massacre resulted in the deaths of 41 of his family members back home. He shares that he then started building his life in Lahore and matriculated there. Mr. Butt remembers how positive and passionate his father was about Pakistan. Mr. Butt reflects that he can never think of visiting Samba again because the trauma he faced remains fresh in his mind.
