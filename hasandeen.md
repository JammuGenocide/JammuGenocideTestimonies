Hassan Deen was born around 1931 or 1932 in the village of Kanger, in the town of Bhalwal, Jammu District. Mr. Deen is part of the Gujjar community, whose main occupation was raising cattle and sheep. The community is nomadic, migrating twice a year. Their winter residence was Kanger and their summer residence was Pandorian.

Mr. Deen remembers people from multiple communities peacefully co-existing in his village. They would celebrate all their festivals together and even participate in each other’s marriage ceremonies. Mr. Deen remembered all this with much nostalgia, lamenting the paucity of today’s interpersonal relationships, a problem he blames on increased individuality and greed for money.

Mr. Deen says that back then, the language that people spoke was Gojri while Urdu was the language of writing and study. Farming was the main occupation available to people, with the main crops being wheat, maize, and bajra (pearl millet). The social life of the village revolved around marriages; each one was a big celebration often including around 1000 people. Marriages used to be arranged only during winter seasons. It was a local tradition that the baraat (groom's wedding procession) would stay for one or two nights at the bride’s place.

Mr. Deen was about six years old and living in Kanger during Partition. They found out about it by seeing the displacement of other, more advanced villages. When their village was attacked, Mr. Deen remembers that people went to a famous man of the time, a man known as Jang Bhahadur of ‘Panj Grain’ from the town of Nagrota. His own grandfather asked Jang Bhahadur to help them cross the border and reach Pakistan. Jang Bhahadur arrived in Kanger the following day. He spread a sheet on the ground and demanded that everyone put all their money and jewelry on it. After collecting everyone’s valuables, he took all the Gujjars - around 300 of them - with him, only to mislead them and send them towards Belli (a dense forest of bushes at the banks of the Tawi River near Nagrota). He had them cross the Tawi River, claiming that the other side was Pakistan. As soon as they crossed the Tawi, however, they were attacked by a violent mob. Mr. Deen remembers that most of the people in the group perished in the attack, save for a few of them who managed to run into the forest and hide. Mr. Deen, along with his family, was one of these lucky few. He, his father, and his uncle all went deep into one part of the forest while his mother, his two sisters, paternal aunt, and two cousins all hid in another part of the forest. They stayed in the forest, without any food or water, for seven long days.

Eventually, once he, his father, and his uncle began to move out of the forest, they came across a man wearing a variant of pajamas commonly worn by the Dogras of Jammu. After some initial suspicion, they realized this man belonged to the Teli tribe. He would later help them locate Mr. Deen’s mother and the other ladies. \Soon, the family began retreating towards their home. Tragically, on the way back, they were attacked by a violent mob: all of the ladies and his maternal grandparents and uncles lost their lives. Mr. Deen remembers himself and the rest of his family running for their lives, tripping over many dead bodies along the way.

Another of Mr. Deen’s sisters was caught by an ironsmith in their village. She was eventually sent to Panjtirthi, and from which she was put onto a Pakistan-bound bus. She was married off to someone in Pakistan as soon as she arrived. She visited her home for a month after her marriage. Unfortunately, she passed away a few years ago; Mr. Deen went to Pakistan to participate in her funeral.

After a few years, Mr. Deen went back to Kanger only to find their house destroyed and land abandoned. He had only come back to start life anew after the announcement of normalcy by Sheikh Abdullah. Mr. Deen got married in 1957. His wife suddenly passed away after a year, and he remarried in 1962. Mr. Deen moved to Pandorian in 1965. Today, he has two daughters and four sons. He and his wife live with his youngest son.
