-------------------------------------------

Sardarna Begum was born in Kathua District of Jammu and Kashmir. She had seven brothers. Her mother passed away when she was young. Sardarna Begun was acquainted with the horror of Partition a few days after the government announced that the Muslim population settled near the mosque of Mulla Talab had to move to Pakistan. The announcement was made on October 7, 1947. Large numbers of people from the adjoining villages gather near the mosque of Mulla Talab. Sardarna Begum was present among them too. Members of an extremist party, dressed in uniform, came to escort the migrants. The migrants were told that buses would arrive to take them to Pakistan. On the way, all the valuables that the migrants were carrying with them were looted by the same people who promised them safe passage to Pakistan. The migrants were then shot at gunpoint or slain with sharp-edged swords. Sardarna Begumâ€™s father and brother were killed in this turmoil. Sardarna Begum was made married just a year before Partition. She had a six-month-old daughter who was also snatched from her arms and butchered with a sword right in front her eyes. She herself was injured and suffered deep cuts on her head and stomach. Such were the severity of her injuries that she was unconscious for one whole day. Sardarna Begum laments the fact that the last rites of the dead migrants could not be performed amidst the chaos. She could not go to Pakistan.

Sardarna Begum, along with other women, found shelter in a wealthy household. Her in-laws from the first marriage left for Pakistan. They would perform various domestic chores for the family that had given them refuge. Many of the women of the community were also abducted by people from other communities. Later on, Sardarna Begum and some other women were taken by the people to a refugee camp. It took a month for the situation to grow normal.

Sardarna Begum remembers that many Hindu families settled in villages near their camp assisted them with their requirements. They also helped her to remarry and settle down. She became a mother to eight children. The house she lived in was forcefully occupied by people of other communities but she was able to regain possession by moving the applications to the tehsildar and other officials. She is haunted by the memories of Partition, especially the loss of her daughter. She expresses her deep sorrow over the loss of family members.
