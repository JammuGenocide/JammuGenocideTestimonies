Mr. Ghulam Nabi Malik was born in the Reasi District of what is now Jammu and Kashmir. His father worked as an employee of the silk industry, which was owned by the government of Raja Hari Singh. It was a lucrative department of government and drew a handsome salary from the king. Mr. Malik states that his childhood memories are excellent despite his advancing age. He recalls that the village primary school had an easy syllabus. Students used wooden and iron slates, and the curriculum comprised only two books, for Urdu and mathematics.

Mr. Malik was an eyewitness to the turmoil in Rajouri between October 1947 and April 1948. He says, ‘’Tribal men entered Rajouri from the Pakistani side of North Waziristan to overthrow Raja Hari Singh’s government.” When his mother heard that the tribesmen were coming from across the mountain, she hid her three sisters in large storage boxes for safety. They arrested his father for being a servant in the Raja government and took him away to some unknown place. Looting, murder, and rape became common, and the anarchy affected everyone in the area, irrespective of religion. A new maharaja was appointed by these tribal men. Mr. Malik’s mother lodged a complaint to the maharaja about the abduction of her husband; however, he did not acknowledge her complaint. Mr. Malik and his sisters traveled by caravan to a safe area near the border of Pakistan. His mother and father later joined the family in refugee camps. All the caravans of refugees gathered in Kalra village, where they boarded a train for Mansar camp in Attock, West Punjab. Young Mr. Maliki was admitted to third grade at Mansar Camp, in 1950. The family remained in refugee camps for five years. There was a scarcity of rations, and hygiene conditions were poor. In the early days there, they survived by boiling leaves of vegetables from vegetable markets, and begged for food and for work. These early days of settlement were horrible. Mr. Malik’s family remained in refugee camps for five years.

In 1952, they were allocated land in Mandi Bahauddin, West Punjab. His father built a cottage and became famous as “the cottage old man.” No pump was available for pumping water from wells, so water had to be fetched from the pumps of neighbors. Mr. Malik was admitted to the sixth grade in 1952 in Mandi Bahauddin, and he completed his matriculation standard in 1958. He joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), where he completed a bachelor’s degree. He participated in many UN missions abroad while serving with the PAF. Mr. Malik retired as a master warrant officer in 1994. He was married in 1963 to his cousin after his return from Dhaka while serving in the air force.

After retirement Mr. Malik became a journalist, publishing regularly in the Jazba newspaper. He remains a local reporter for the Observer and Dawn newspapers. Mr. Malik and his offspring hold permanent Kashmiri birth certificates, and he wishes Kashmir were an independent state. He submitted a request to Kashmir’s Chief Minister, Mehbooba Mufti, to allow him to visit the city of his birth.
