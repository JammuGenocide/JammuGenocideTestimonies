Mrs. Wazira Begum was born in 1932 in Pacca Danga of Jammu District. She lived in Jammu with her siblings, till she got married at the age of 15. Her father was a tailor and mother a homemaker. She studied in a girls’ school, Kacchi Chawani in Jammu. She recalls that the school had only female teachers and they wore the traditional blue salwar kurta with a white dupatta to their classes. Describing their family life in Jammu, she shares that her family had very cordial relations with the people of the locality and there was a sense of brotherhood. Wazira Begum mentions the festival of Baisakhi and Eid which were celebrated with huge pomp and show. People gathered together and organized feasts for the residents of the colony.

The early months of 1947 saw a lot of changes, people had started migrating from their houses in order to protect their lives. She tells the narrative of her own family, how she lost several family members in 1947. Her mother and two brothers were killed during the time of Partition. They were absolutely clueless as to why they were being attacked. Her father got several injuries and died after a few days of stay at the camp. Her younger sister took refuge with a Gujjar family of the locality to save her life from the mob. Many women were abducted by the people of other communities. Wazira Begum’s sister was found after ten days in the camp at Jammu.

After a few days, there was peace in the city. Wazira Begum came back to her house, only to find an empty house. It was not what she had left behind, all the material possessions had been looted. She was a social worker for a long time. She got married and was then elected as the sarpanch (village head) from her village Latti in Udhampur District of Jammu. She was nominated twice as the legislative council member of J&K. She was also a member of the National Conference party of J&K.
